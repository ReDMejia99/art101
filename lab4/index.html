	<h1>Lab 4</h1>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<div class="p1"
<p>We have had difficulty linking the css file to our html in lab 4 but we figured it out on a MAC just not on Windows PC.We also had questions in regards to indenting in pseudocode but understood the main idea. </p>
</div>

	<h3>Problems</h3>

	<div class="p1"
<p>We found it difficult to know an exact way to input code whether it is css, html, or pseudocode because when researching there are multiple ways to create specific codes to perform certain functions. </p>
</div>

	<h4>Results</h4>
	<h5> Connect Four Pseudocode </h5>
	<pre><code>
		<p>
		//Give the red coins to one player and the black coins to the other player
		//Create a 6x7 grid
		//First player inserts one of their coins into a column of their choosing
		//After, second player inserts one of their coins into a column of their choosing
		//Each player evaluates possible moves before inserting their coins
		//Repeat steps 3 and 4, alternating players
		//One of the players wins by having four of their same colored coins in a row
		</pre></code>
</p>
<h6> Everyday Task Pseudocode</h6>
<p>

	<pre><code>
		<p>
		//Grab a cup
		//Put ice in the cup
		//Place cup with ice under coffee filter
		//Pour coffee grounds into filter
		//Boil a glass of water
		//Pour boiling water into the coffee filter
		//Let it seep for 1 minute into ice cup
