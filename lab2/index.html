		<h1> Hello World </h1>

		<p>My name is LJ. I am originally from Venture, which is a little coastal town in Southern California. I am currently a freshman at UCSC and love to make art with charcoals and oil pastels. Whenever I am not painting and drawing I am swimming in the ocean.</p>
			<p>My name is Reece. I am from the central valley in Northern CA. I transferred to UCSC as an art major. I love digital art but I also enjoy acrylic paints.</p>
