			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> For this lab the only challenge we faced was figuring out how to make our output for what we enter into our text box print out to give the answers we want. We were able to solve this easily by checking for the problem in our console and going back to define a variable.  </p>
			<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p> The only problem we faced was trying to come up with a creative way to change the theme of the lab so we could make it our own but we decided to choose the theme of "The Hunger Games."   </p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> We were able to successfully create an input form that worked with our functions in js which allowed us to enter any name and it would print out a result based off the length of the name, in this case we did different districts from the movie "The Hunger Games."  </p>

			<div class = "input-output">
				<h3> Thank You for Joining Us for The 150th Annual Hunger Games </h3>
				<p> Please enter your full name in order to reveal which district you have the honor of representing in the Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor.</p>
				Please enter your name to see your chosen district:
				<input type = "text" id = "input">
				<button id = "button">Submit</button>
