			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> We were challenged with figuring out how to implement the "nameSort" function with an "event listener" in order to create a working function that performs all the tasks listed in the instructions. </p>
			<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p> We ran into the problem of not knowing what information to input into our function. </p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> Overall we were able to solve all our problems by focusing on one task at a time and referencing back to our notes to clarify what type of information we would input into our functions. Finally we realized that we were overthinking the tasks and just needed to organize our code so it was not overwhelming and could make more sense.   </p>
