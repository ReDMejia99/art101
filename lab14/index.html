			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<div class = "p1">
			<p1> We were challenged with remembering any minor details we missed in past assignments that we would want to add  since we fully completed all our labs. Then I had an issue figuring out where certain files were located for past labs because I had edited them in the past and did not label them correctly.</p>
		</div>

			<h3> Problems</h3>

			<div class = "p2">
			<p2>  We had issues figuring out how to work with certain details in css in the past but were able to add things such as colored borders to make our lab more stylized. We also had trouble understanding how to organize this lab and what screenshots to put where.  </p>
		</div>

			<h4> Results</h4>

			<div class = "p3">
			<p3>  We were able to complete all our past labs and fix any minor issues we had, as well as adding more to css to make our labs look more distinguished and pleasing to look at. </p>
