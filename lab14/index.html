				<h1> Lab 14 Debugging Tools and Strategies </h1>
		</div>
				</div>





			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<div class = "p1">
			<p1> We were challenged with remembering any minor details we missed in past assignments that we would want to add  since we fully completed all our labs. </p>
		</div>

			<h3> Problems</h3>

			<div class = "p2">
			<p2>  We had issues figuring out how to work with certain details in css in the past but were able to add things such as colored borders to make our lab more stylized. We also had trouble figuring out how to translate a working code that we had in lab 13 to be in Jquery and still work.  </p>
		</div>

			<h4> Results</h4>

			<div class = "p3">
			<p3>  We were able to complete all our past labs and fix any minor issues we had, as well as adding more to css to make our labs look more distinguished and pleasing to look at. </p>
