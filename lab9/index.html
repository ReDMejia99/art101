			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> We were challenged with figuring out how to include a div id in place of div class which is what we usually use but easily solved that problem by realizing they are for the most part interchangeable.  </p>
			<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p> We ran into the problem of how to work with the code in the console to create a new element but figured it out after experimenting with different inputs. </p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> Overall we were able to construct a working website that we then added elements to in order to practice creating and editing exisiting ones.   </p>
