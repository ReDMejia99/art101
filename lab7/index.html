			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I struggled at first with creating the Lab 7 file structure but after we figured it out it was just a matter of understanding what to input for our code. </p>
			<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p> We had trouble printing the output at first but just had to make some minor changes because we added an extra letter to a word. </p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> My partner and I successfully experimented with coding for JavaScript functions and were able to create a window to input passwords into. </p>
